# Population Model

To gain insight on the process of building a mathematical model, this will be an attempt at creating multiple iterations of a crude model of the USA's population at any given time.

### Challenges
As I attempt to make the model more accurate, external contributors (ie. Motor vehicle accidents affect on death rate) need to be identified and included.

### Validation
Crude models will be validated using projections released by the United States Census Bureau
